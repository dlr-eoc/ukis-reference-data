## Burnt Area Research

### EnMAP burnt area perimeter reference dataset

- [burntarea/enmap_wavelengths/enmap_aois.geojson](burntarea/enmap_wavelenghts/enmap_aois.geojson): The footprints of the analysed scenes, together with the
name of the AOI
- [burntarea/enmap_wavelengths/enmap_ba_reference.geojson](burntarea/enmap_wavelenghts/enmap_ba_reference.geojson): The digitized burnt area perimeters, together with relevant meta information such as the EnMAP scene id

## What is UKIS?
The DLR project Environmental and Crisis Information System (the German abbreviation is UKIS, standing for [Umwelt- und Kriseninformationssysteme](https://www.dlr.de/eoc/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-5413/10560_read-21914/) aims at harmonizing the development of information systems at the German Remote Sensing Data Center (DFD) and setting up a framework of modularized and generalized software components.

UKIS is intended to ease and standardize the process of setting up specific information systems and thus bridging the gap from EO product generation and information fusion to the delivery of products and information to end users.

Furthermore, the intention is to save and broaden know-how that was and is invested and earned in the development of information systems and components in several ongoing and future DFD projects.
